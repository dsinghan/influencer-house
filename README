Influencer House

Description:
        Influencer House is a social media platform allowing for influencers to easily and efficiently connect with their fans and followers. I worked on writing code to modify and add to our existing administrator panel, allowing for ease of use and efficient navigation.
        For the admin panel web page, I added a tab display to organize and display our collected data and customized the UI to provide a better look. I made use of Node.js with React to generate content along with HTML and CSS to construct our display according to the specifications.

Included files:
        Detail.js - javascript source file that renders the Users page with all functionality of our administrator panel
